## About The Project
This project demonstrates various techniques to clean and transform data in a SQL database. The dataset used is from PortfolioProject..Nashvillehousing. The cleaning process includes converting date formats, populating missing data, splitting address columns, standardizing column values, removing duplicates, and deleting unused columns.

## Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel:** A source file which is loaded into the SSMS- Sql server management Studio for cleaning the data 
- **SQL:** Utilized to extract, transform, and analyze housing data data from Excel, to clean the data which includes - Splitting the columns and changing the format and removing the redundancies

## Approach 
- **Data Collection, Preparation, Transformation and Structuring:** SQL was used to extract the excel data which is futher used for running scripts for cleanning, and organizing raw data, removing duplicates and standardizing formats to ensure accuracy. SQL was used to query and aggregate data from Excel, allowing efficient structuring of the housing data.

## Key features
- **Data Integration:** Extraction and integration of COVID-19 data from Excel for in-depth analysis.
- **Data Validation and Querying:** SQL querying ensures accurate and consistent data handling, providing reliable insights and metrics.
- **Visualization:** Engaging charts, graphs, and maps in Tableau illustrate trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
- **Interactivity:** Includes dynamic filters and drill-down features to explore data by different locations, dates, and population metrics.
- **Global and Continental Insights:** Aggregated data views highlight global and continental COVID-19 impacts, comparing regions with the highest infection and death rates.
- **Population vs. Infection Analysis:** Calculations provide insights into infection rates relative to population, enabling a clear understanding of regional impact.

## Benefits 
- **Improved Consistency:** Standardized formats (e.g., dates and categorical values) ensure uniformity across the dataset, reducing errors in analysis.
- **Enhanced Completeness:** Filling missing data and splitting compound columns make the dataset more comprehensive and detailed.
- **Easier Analysis:** Cleaned and organized data simplifies grouping, filtering, and reporting for insights and decision-making.
- **Better Integration:** Consistent and accurate data facilitates seamless integration with other systems and tools.

## Status 
- Data Cleaning in SQL **Completed**
